# Preschooler data for R
Ninety three preschoolers' scores on a Theory of Mind scale (ToM), a fairness game and a family relationship test (BA).

**This dataset includes the following key measurements**:
1) age: by month
2) ToM: children's performance on the The Theory of Mind Scale (TMS) (Wellman & Liu, 2004). A higher T score indicates a better theory of mind ability.
3) BA: The Bene-Anthony Family Relations Test was used to assess children's perceptions of family relations. A higher BA score represents a better family relation.
4) Fairness Emotion: child’s emotional reaction to a fair allocation (each party recives the same amount of resources). It was measured by The Sad–neutral–happy Facial Expression Scale (Wellman et al.,2004). There are five faces expressing five different emotions: very happy, happy, neutral, sad and very sad, which scored from 1 to 5 as a five point likert scale. 

**The key research questions for exploration**: 
1) what is the developmental effect on preschoolers' fairness emotion development? 
2) how ToM affect preschoolers' fairness emotion development? 
3) What is the role of family relation in preschoolers' fairness emotion development? 
4) if better family relation predicted better ToM ability, how will this interaction affect preschoolers' fairness emotion development?
